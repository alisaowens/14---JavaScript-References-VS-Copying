  <h1>This JavaScript application demonstrates the differences between references and copies of JavaScript strings, numbers, arrays, and objects. Open the console to see the results ðŸ‘‡</h1>

  <script>
    // Start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Phe';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'Duck';
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'E';

    // However here is the problem: we have edited the original array too. 
    console.log(players, team);

    // Why? Because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array.

    // So, we take a copy instead. You can use slice()
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // or use Array.from()
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: 'Phe Duck',
      age: 60
    };

    // and think we make a copy, but this is actually a reference: 
    const captain = person;
    console.log(person, captain); 
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person, captain); 

    // We can take a copy instead using Object.assign()
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 40, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // Note that this is only 1 level deep, both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const phe = {
      name: 'Phe',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@pheduck',
        facebook: 'pheduck.developer'
      }
    };
    console.log(phe);

    // Demonstrating that this assignment is only one level deep 
    console.log(phe.social.facebook); 
    const dev = Object.assign({}, phe);
    dev.social.facebook = 'new facebook'; 
    console.log(phe.social.facebook); 

    // One way to make a copy that is more than 1 level deep: 
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(phe));
